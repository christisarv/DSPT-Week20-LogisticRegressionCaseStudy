# Part Time Data Science: Week 20 - Logistic Regression Case Study

This week looks a little different! Fork and clone this repo, then explore the Example Case Study to see how to explore thresholding with Logistic Regression. Then, open up the other Case Study notebook and apply what you've learned from the example!
 
I'll note that I walked through the Example Case Study at the end of my Topic 28 Study Group for DS-PT-092820 (hosted on Feb 24, 2021) if you'd like to refer to that video for more details.
